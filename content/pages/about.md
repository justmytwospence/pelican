I'm a data scientist in training - currently an MS candidate in the
[Analytics program at the University of San Francisco][]. Previously, I
studied neuroscience at Rice University, followed by two years
conducting [neuroimaging research at Stanford University][]. I jumped
off the pre-med track when I got bit by the Silicon Valley bug and fell
in love with statistics, startups, computer science, and machine
learning. During my tenure in the USF Master's program, I've interned
with the data science teams at [AutoGrid Systems][] and [Uber][]. The
aim of this blog is to be a learning tool for myself and hopefully
others. Herein I attempt to curate the latest and greatest in the world
of data science, as well as my personal projects. Don't hesitate to
reach out for any reason! Questions, ideas, and collaborations are
always welcome.
