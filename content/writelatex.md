If you use $\LaTeX$ and haven't yet heard of
$write\LaTeX$, do yourself a favor and check it out. On one level
its a really great version of Google Docs for documents that are
properly typeset, which is incredibly useful because a huge swathe of
the documents created with $\LaTeX$ are inherently collaborative in
nature. Its other fantastic feature is that your $\LaTeX$ markup is
automatically rendered in real-time (or close to it, at least, there's a
few seconds of lag depending on the length of the document). This made
writing my first $\LaTeX$ intensive document a great experience,
because I could experiment liberally with equations and figure
placement. There's literally zero barrier to entry because its
completely web based; you don't need to install a thing and templates
are available to get you jump-started. Right now other engines like
XeLaTeX aren't supported, but I believe they are in the works.  

So every excuse you ever had to not learn $\LaTeX$ has been
obliterated. [Give it a try][], or just be passive aggressive
and send it to that collaborator that always sends you everything in a
poorly formatted Word document. I myself will be experimenting with
using $\LaTeX$ to take math-heavy notes in real-time, which sounds
crazy but the live rendering makes the attempt feasible.
