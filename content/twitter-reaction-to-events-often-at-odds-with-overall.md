[Twitter Reaction to Events Often at Odds with Overall Public Opinion][]

<div class="link_description">
This is a long-standing beef that I have always had with any
Twitter-sentiment analysis. A huge chunk of people tweeting are just
whiny adolescents who wouldn’t even be polled if we were to design a
huge study. I haven’t heard of any twitter-mining tools or packages that
allow you to filter the Twitterers that you are pulling your random
sample of tweets from. That would certainly be worthwhile and would make
a lot of people care a lot more about Twitter sentiment analyses.
