Have you ever thought of what a ridiculous superpower the ability to speak is? If I want somebody else to know something, I don’t have to wait until that idea pops into their head (the likelihood of which approaches zero). I can actually ***put*** it there. But there is no way to transfer the pattern of action potentials in my brain’s wiring directly into someone else’s wiring because our brains are simply too important to not be 100% encased in protective skull. And make no mistake, thats exactly what you are doing when you talk to someone: you are changing the way their brain is firing, which is nothing less than ***who they are*** at the most fundamental and meaningful level.

Not only that, I don’t even have to be able to see them or be anywhere ***near*** them to do so. I take the enormous complexity of information that is making up my thoughts (who I ***am***) and succinctly encode it in a pattern of vibration. I can then simply ***will*** the air molecules 200 feet away to vibrate in accordance with the pattern that represents my state of being. That part is incredible. I can simply cause a piece of nature that contains no information to be saturated with information from huge distances. Mind. Blown.

As if that wasn’t enough, the receiver of that information gets a boat-load of ***meta*** information where the source of that information is in physical space ***despite*** the fact that she only has access to the air molecules within an inch or two of her head.
