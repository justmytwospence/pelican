Our program hosted its own Kaggle-style competition
this quarter, featuring a “mystery” dataset with a binary target
variable. I was impressed by the reveal.js javascript library, so I put
together our final slides using it, both because its pretty, and as a
way to get some more practice with HTML, CSS, and javascript. On top of
that, I had to expand my knowledge of Git in order to publish it on
their GitHub Pages platform, so wins all around. Check out the work of
