My friend and classmate [Trevor Stephens][] has
created some [pretty stellar R tutorials][] that will take you to about
halfway up the leaderboard of Kaggle's [Titanic: Machine Learning from
Disaster][] competition. While the competition has a [Python tutorial][]
and even a beginner's [Excel tutorial][], any R equivalent had been
suspiciously lacking. This is the competition that served as our first
foray into machine learning, so kudos to Trevor for giving back to the
community!
