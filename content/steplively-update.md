This week I got an email from RStudio letting me know that after a week or two of waiting, I’ve been assigned 2GB of space on their servers for hosting Shiny apps. So now you can click on the above link to see the live version of my stepwise regression app that I posted last week. In celebration, I’ve added a few extras to the app, including the ability to upload your own data set, although its not a particularly robust feature yet.  

Update: I’ve recently moved to Rstudio’s next-gen hosting platform: shinyapps.io. This was necessary because I was having issues installing low-level packages like Rcpp onto their Spark server. This new platform is much more flexible in this regard. I’ve updated links accordingly.
