If you need to switch back to an older version of R
to use a particular package, it doesnâ€™t get easier than downloading the
[RSwitcher utility from AT&T][].

I use homebrew to keep my main installation up-to-date, and then
switching back to 2.7 when I need a certain package is as easy as one
click.
