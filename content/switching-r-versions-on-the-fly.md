summary: Easily switch R versions!

If you need to switch back to an older version of R to use a particular package, it doesnâ€™t get easier than downloading the [RSwitcher utility from AT&T][].  

I use homebrew to keep my main installation up-to-date, and then switching back to 2.7 when I need a certain package is as easy as one click.
