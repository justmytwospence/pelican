Despite being slightly colorblind, I’m one of those
people who is bizarrely anal-retentive when it comes to color-schemes in
the software that I use. I use custom CSS extensions in Chrome to make
the color schemes of websites like Wikipedia, Youtube, etc a bit more
pleasing. I did some digging in the accessibility preference pane of
Adobe Reader to make the default document background a nice book-like
sepia tone which makes reading PDFs online a much less straining
endeavor (incidentally - Google Play Books *only* has a white background
which is why I greatly prefer the Amazon Kindle web app). I’ve spent
wayy too long (as I think many geeks do), customizing my terminal and
custom android ROM themes. I think you get the picture.

Anyways, I had been using the Solarized palette for a lot of things
because it seems like its choices are a bit less arbitrary and has some
science behind it (although I haven’t done any research into how
legitimate that science is). Its a bit limiting, however, and recently
I’ve been attracted to the Holo color palette that ICS compliant Android
apps use. I couldn’t find a pre-compiled Holo palette in .clr format for
use in the Mac OSX Color Picker utility, so I made a simple, bare-bones
one. First I had to download the HEX plugin from [wafflesoftware.net][]
which for some strange reason is not a functionality that Apple thought
worthwhile to put into a color picker (???). [You can download my .clr
palette right here][]. Maybe I can save the next anal-retentive googler
a few minutes.

PS. While I am talking about color - if you haven’t heard of [fl.ux][],
check it out. It is a magical little utility that warms the color of
your screen automatically after sunset and can *really* save your eyes
and make getting to sleep a little bit easier if you are working in
front of your screen late at night.
