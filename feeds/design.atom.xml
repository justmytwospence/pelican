people who is bizarrely anal-retentive when it comes to color-schemes in
the software that I use. I use custom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; extensions in Chrome to make
the color schemes of websites like Wikipedia, Youtube, etc a bit more
pleasing. I did some digging in the accessibility preference pane of
Adobe Reader to make the default document background a nice book-like
sepia tone which makes reading PDFs online a much less straining
endeavor (incidentally - Google Play Books &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; has a white background
which is why I greatly prefer the Amazon Kindle web app). I’ve spent
wayy too long (as I think many geeks do), customizing my terminal and
custom android &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; themes. I think you get the&amp;nbsp;picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I had been using the Solarized palette for a lot of things
because it seems like its choices are a bit less arbitrary and has some
science behind it (although I haven’t done any research into how
legitimate that science is). Its a bit limiting, however, and recently
I’ve been attracted to the Holo color palette that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICS&lt;/span&gt; compliant Android
apps use. I couldn’t find a pre-compiled Holo palette in .clr format for
use in the Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSX&lt;/span&gt; Color Picker utility, so I made a simple, bare-bones
one. First I had to download the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HEX&lt;/span&gt; plugin from &lt;a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/"&gt;wafflesoftware.net&lt;/a&gt;
which for some strange reason is not a functionality that Apple thought
worthwhile to put into a color picker (???). &lt;a href="http://db.tt/xU7lyIBh"&gt;You can download my .clr
palette right here&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe I can save the next anal-retentive googler
a few&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;. While I am talking about color - if you haven’t heard of &lt;a href="http://justgetflux.com/"&gt;fl.ux&lt;/a&gt;,
check it out. It is a magical little utility that warms the color of
your screen automatically after sunset and can &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; save your eyes
and make getting to sleep a little bit easier if you are working in
front of your screen late at&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="color"></category><category term="holo"></category><category term="solarized"></category></entry></feed>
