                    <p>We are on the brink of one of the most radical paradigm shifts to affect
human society in millennia. <span class="caps">OK</span>, maybe that that sounds obvious to a lot
of people what with the explosion of innovation that the internet and
other new technologies over the past decade or two. But I’m talking
about a total revamping of an institution that has existed as long as
language has existed- indeed, as long as <em>we</em>have existed:&nbsp;education.</p>
<p>Education has barely changed one iota in the last thousand years of its
practice. Plato and Socrates taught their classes essentially the <em>same
way</em> that a modern philosophy or science class is taught - hell, we
still use the <em>Socratic method</em> in modern classes (this isn’t a claim
that the method is ineffective, merely a demonstration of how long
current practices have existed without drastic change). Dozens of
students congregate where the one who has the knowledge is located, and
this one knowledgable person teaches a concept to the students and
answers questions. The only change in the late 1900s was that there were
significantly more places where this happened - called&nbsp;colleges/universities.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lux6c2LeEa1r0kwho.jpg" /></p>
<p>But colleges/universities were designed in an ancient world. They were
built to spread knowledge in an era of very few knowledgable people
relative to the entire population, when the most efficient way - and
indeed the <em>only</em>way - of conducting this transfer of knowledge was
face-to-face. This is no longer the world that we live in. Courtesy of
modern technology, we live in a globally connected world with accessible
experts in any field you’d care to study, and I don’t think that modern
institutions of higher learning will survive the shift. At least not in
a state that anywhere near resembles the way they operate&nbsp;now.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lux6czF6On1r0kwho.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Exhibit&nbsp;A</strong></p>
<p>If you want to get an idea of what the new face of eduction will be
like, look to Stanford University, the bleeding edge of the move toward
the new&nbsp;system. </p>
<p>This semester, two Stanford-level courses were made available <em>for free</em>
to <em>anyone</em> with an internet connection: Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. These courses were taught
by some of the biggest names in the field. Andrew Ng and his team
created the Machine Learning course, which is the one that I am
currently enrolled in, so its the one I’ll talk&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Over 65,000 students are enrolled. <a href="">Here’s a map showing a little
cross-section of where they come from</a> (spoiler alert- its
<em>everywhere</em>). Skimming the extensive “introductions” section of the
class forum reveals that these students are incredibly diverse, from
software engineer professionals working here in silicon valley to high
school students in poor eastern European communities and absolutely
everything in&nbsp;between. </p>
<p>Online courses in and of themselves are not particularly new-
institutions such as <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm"><span class="caps">MIT</span></a>, <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley</a>, <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/">Yale</a>, and many other
traditionally well known schools have been making lectures and course
materials available online for years. The key difference is that this
new wave of online courses are designed specifically and exclusively for
the new global audience. This is immediately apparent in the
presentation of the lectures, the format of the homework assignments,
and the design of the curriculum. The result is a learning experience
that I argue rivals that of any traditional college&nbsp;course. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luxge4HuZN1r0kwho.jpg" /></p>
<p>The homework assignments for Ng’s class include quizzes that solidify
the students intuition of the concept, combined with specific
programming problem sets that gives the student a handle on concrete
implementation of the ideas using Octave (a freeware version of <span class="caps">MATLAB</span>).
As someone who has taken similar <span class="caps">MATLAB</span> courses at a well known private
university, I can confidently attest to the relative efficacy of the new&nbsp;format.</p>
<p>There are differences of course. To clear up misunderstandings that I
have, I used to go to a review session- usually led by a <span class="caps">TA</span>- who would
try to answer the questions of dozens of students within a few hours.
Now- I simply post a question to the class forum and have it answered
<em>very</em>quickly by up to dozens of knowledgable practitioners- many of
whom are already implementing similar programming techniques in their
line of&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Another significant difference is that instead of 200 different
lecturers teaching the same topic to 65,000 learners, we have 1. This
may strike some as a disadvantage- but in the future, this system will
allow the best lecturers to float to the top. Think about how much more
cost effective this is- if we replace 200 lecturers with 1, we are
cutting the costs of education by a factor of hundreds, not to mention
drastically expanding the number of students we can&nbsp;reach.</p>
<p>Note that in the above point I mention only <em>lecturers,</em>not
<em>teachers.</em>What I believe we will see is a simultaneous centralization
of certain aspects of education and decentralization of others. In an
increasingly connected world, everyone becomes a teacher. Are you a
computer programmer? You are also going to be a programming teacher. Are
you a marketing analyst? Guess what, you are also going to be a teacher
of marketing. In a way that seems contradictory at first- this
consolidation of our currently bloated educational system will provide
the infrastructure necessary to bring back peer-to-peer transfer of&nbsp;knowledge.</p>
<p>Stanford is expanding their open courses next semester, and my
prediction is that it only gets bigger from here.  Below is a list of
the next classes to be offered (still trying to decide which ones I will
have the time to participate in!). I highly recommend them to everyone
who is at all&nbsp;interested.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lux62tK2sp1r0kwho.jpg" /></strong></p>
<p>The role of the university will have to change dramatically if and when
such a system becomes the norm. One key role they will have to play lies
in accreditation. (At least for now) students enrolled in these
Education2.0 courses do so merely for the knowledge gained. There is no
course credit gained which is a double edged sword. On the one hand, it
means students are that much more collaborative. Cheating becomes a
non-issue in such an environment. The key question becomes how to decide
which students are qualified for a given job, etc. Instead of
having accreditation agencies give the seal of approval to other
institutions who then parcel out degrees, we might see a move toward
tests or other processes to directly accreditate&nbsp;individuals.</p>
<p>I could continue to wildly speculate on the issue and I have lots more
ideas about how things might pan out (future blog topics might include
how <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> is turning primary school education on its head, or
how studio schools and apprenticeship systems are on the rise as well).
If you disagree or would like to point out how any of these particular
ideas are crazy, leave a comment! Please! All that I do know is that
with tuition prices rising <em>outrageously</em> every year while wonderful
free alternative options begin to proliferate, <strong>something’s gotta&nbsp;give.</strong></p>
