TO DO
=====

- Switch from Knitr's syntax highlighting to Pygments. This might require custom hooks in Knitr.
- Improve typography.
- Look into simpler ways to add scripts to individual posts.
- Add the sidebar modifications to templates other than index, article, and page.
- Figure out where a few ugly CSS styles are coming from (mainly the dashed underlines for links).
- Remove border from code snippets that aren't part of an IPython notebook.
